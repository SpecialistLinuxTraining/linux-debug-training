## Introduction

Linux is at the heart of our modern world. From the devices we carry in our pockets to the systems that power industries, Linux, and particularly embedded Linux, plays a pivotal role. It drives the technology behind smart home devices, medical equipment, automotive systems, and so much more. These systems aren't just conveniences—they're critical to how we live, work, and innovate.

But with great complexity comes great challenges. Debugging these systems is an intricate process that requires a deep understanding of tools and techniques. The stakes are high—whether it's ensuring a life-saving device operates flawlessly or guaranteeing the safety of an autonomous vehicle.

Acquiring these debugging skills is no easy feat. It demands not only technical expertise but also hands-on experience with the tools and processes that define the Linux ecosystem. And that's where this course steps in.

This course brings together all the essential material in one place, simplifying the complex and equipping you with the skills you need to excel. You'll master tools like GDB, learn to analyze core dumps, and understand how to debug segmentation faults and shared libraries. Whether you're troubleshooting a single device or an entire system, these skills will set you apart.

By the end of this journey, you'll be prepared to tackle the toughest debugging challenges in the Linux world, contributing to the technologies that shape our lives. Ready to dive in?

## Course Description

In Part 1 of this course, you will learn the essential skills for debugging Linux systems, from diagnosing segmentation faults to working with core dumps and mastering foundational debugging tools like GDB. These skills will give you the ability to troubleshoot a wide range of problems in user space and provided a strong starting point for deeper exploration.

Part 2 builds on that foundation and takes you into the advanced areas of Linux debugging. This is where you move beyond the basics and begin to explore the powerful techniques used by senior engineers to solve the most difficult and elusive problems in complex Linux systems.

You will learn how to trace both user space and kernel space activity, giving you deep insight into how processes and the kernel interact at runtime. You will gain expertise in advanced profiling techniques for memory, CPU, and hardware performance analysis, as well as approaches for visualizing data to better understand where performance bottlenecks occur. Finally, you will develop the ability to debug at the kernel level, diagnosing kernel crashes and runtime errors, using interactive kernel debuggers, and working with modern diagnostic tools like KASAN, UBSAN, and KCSAN. These skills will give you the confidence to fix problems that others may find impossible to diagnose.

## Stay Relevant for Our Evolving World

The world of software development is changing rapidly. With the rise of AI-assisted coding, many teams are generating large volumes of code quickly and at scale. While this can accelerate development, it often introduces subtle bugs and hard-to-diagnose issues that AI cannot fix. As companies increasingly rely on AI to handle routine coding tasks, there will be a growing need for engineers with advanced debugging expertise who can step in when things go wrong. This course prepares you for that future by giving you the ability to understand and correct issues that go beyond the reach of automated tools.

One of the challenges in learning these advanced skills is that the information is scattered across countless sources, often buried in outdated documentation or fragmented tutorials. Searching the web for answers can be frustrating and extremely time-consuming. This course brings everything together in one structured, practical program so you can focus on learning rather than piecing together random information.

By the end of our course, you will have acquired a comprehensive set of techniques for tracing, profiling, and debugging at every level of the Linux system. Whether you are working on embedded devices, cloud infrastructure, or mission-critical systems, these skills will allow you to diagnose and solve the toughest problems with confidence.

If you want to become the person others rely on when complex, high-stakes issues arise, this course will give you the expertise to take on that role.
