# Explanation of the C File

my_variable: A simple static variable to demonstrate conditional debugging.
dynamic_debug_example_init(): -> This is the module's initialization function. It contains several pr_debug() statements, which are the key for dynamic debugging. These messages will only be printed if debugging is enabled for the corresponding file, function, or line. It also includes a regular pr_info() and printk(KERN_WARNING ...) to show that these always print, regardless of dynamic debug settings.

A conditional pr_debug() based on my_variable is included.

dynamic_debug_example_exit(): -> This is the module's cleanup function, also containing a pr_debug() statement.

my_function(int arg): -> A simple function with pr_debug() statements at the beginning and within conditional blocks.

another_function(const char \*message): -> Another function with a pr_debug() statement.

some_other_function(void): -> Yet another function with a pr_debug() statement.

module_init() and module_exit(): These macros register the initialization and exit functions.

EXPORT_SYMBOL(): These lines make the my_function, another_function, and some_other_function available for other modules to use (though we won't be explicitly using them in this dynamic debug demonstration, their presence allows for function-based debugging).
